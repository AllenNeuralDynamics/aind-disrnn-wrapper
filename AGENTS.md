Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of picking silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, stop and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No configurability that was not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If the solution is overcomplicated, simplify it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what is needed. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless required.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Match existing style.
- If you find unrelated dead code, mention it but do not delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports, variables, or functions made unused by your change.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Test: Every changed line should trace directly to the request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria and verify.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- Add validation -> write failing tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
- Fix a bug -> write a reproducing test, then make it pass.
- Refactor -> ensure tests pass before and after.

For multi-step tasks, use a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

These guidelines are working when diffs contain fewer unnecessary changes, solutions are simpler, and clarifications happen before implementation.

## 5. HPC Execution Safety

Never run computation-intensive work on the login node (where the agent runs).

- Always use `srun` or `sbatch` for heavy workloads.
- This includes training jobs, sweeps, and tests.
